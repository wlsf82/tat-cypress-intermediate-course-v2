# _Setup_ of local environment with Docker

With docker running on your computer, run the command `docker run --publish 80:80 --publish 22:22 --hostname localhost wlsf82/gitlab-ce` and wait for the environment to boot.

> üïê It will take a few minutes.
>
> ‚òï I recommend grabbing a coffee (or tea) while you wait.
>
> üßë‚Äçüè´ If you use a Mac computer with an m1 or m2 processor, [this other image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yrzr/gitlab-ce-arm64v8) might be better.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **It is worth remembering that this image (`yrzr/gitlab-ce-arm64v8`) is not maintained by Talking About Testing, and therefore, the CSS selectors available during the course classes may not be the same. In this case, you will have to find compatible selectors yourself.**

After a few minutes, access the URL http://localhost to set the `root` user password.

## Setting the `root` user password

When accessing the URL http://localhost for the first time, you should see a page to change the password of the `root` user, as shown below:

![GitLab reset password page](./assets/please-create-a-password-for-your-new-account.png)

Enter a password, confirm it and click the _Change your password_ button.

> The password set here will be used in [lesson 1](./1.md), so use a password you will remember (or make a note of it).
> 
> If you have a computer with an M1 processor and used the `yrzr/gitlab-ce-arm64v8` image, the root user password will already be set and you will need to reset it. To do so, follow these steps, described by one of the students on the course:
>
> First of all, you must have downloaded the Docker interface for Mac.
>
> 1 - On Docker Desktop, go to the terminal of the image you are using (the image needs to be running)
>
> 2 - In the terminal, use the command `gitlab-rake gitlab:password:reset`
>
> 3 - After a few seconds, the terminal will ask which user you want to change the password for, which in this case will be: root
>
> 4 - The terminal will ask you to enter the new password and confirm. Soon after, you will be informed that the password has been changed successfully!

## Creating an Access Token

1. Log in as user `root` with the password defined in the previous section
2. Click on the user's avatar in the upper right corner of the screen; click the _Settings_ link, and then; click on the _Access Tokens_ option (on the left side menu)
3. In the name field, type the value `tat-cypress-intermediate-course-v2`; in the _Scopes_ section check the **api** option; and then click on the _Create personal access token_ button.

> A message that the _token_ was successfully created should be displayed in addition to the _token_ itself. **Copy the _token_ by clicking on the button to the right of the field and save it to use in [Lesson 1](./1.md)**.

## Adding an SSH key

1. In the command line terminal, type the following command and press ENTER `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "root@example.com"`
2. You will be asked for a path to save the key. Press ENTER to accept the default path
3. You will be asked for a password. Press ENTER so that the password is not required
4. You will be asked to repeat the password. Press ENTER again so the password is not required
5. Back in the command line terminal, type the following command and press ENTER to copy the newly created public key to the clipboard `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
6. Logged into the application with the `root` user, click on the user's avatar in the upper right corner of the screen; click the _Settings_ link; and then, click on the _SSH Keys_ option (on the left side menu)
7. Paste your public SSH key into the key field. The _Title_ field should be automatically populated
8. Finally, click on the _Add key_ button.

> üßë‚Äçüè´ You will also find instructions on how to generate the SSH key on Windows OS in the test application itself (running in your local environment with Docker) from the following URL http://localhost/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair.

Okay, the local environment is ready!

Go to [lesson 1](./1.md) to _setup_ the test project with Cypress.
