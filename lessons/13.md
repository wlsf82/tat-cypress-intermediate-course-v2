# Shutting down the container

1. In the command line terminal, run the command `docker container ls`, press ENTER and copy the `CONTAINER ID` referring to the image `wlsf82/gitlab-ce`

2. Finally, execute the command `docker container stop [CONTAINER ID copied in the previous step]` and press ENTER.

> *Note:** After shutting down the container, if you need to start the application again, follow the steps described in the section restarting the container (below).

## Restarting the container

1. Run the command `docker ps -a` (this command will list all containers already downloaded on your computer)
   
2. Save the `CONTAINER ID` from the latest `wlsf82/gitlab-ce` image

3. Run the command `docker container start [CONTAINER ID copied in the previous step]` and press ENTER (this command will start the container with the root user password already defined, in addition to the access token and SSH key already configured).

> ‚ùó Remember to turn off the container when you're not using it so that it doesn't consume computational power on your computer. Just follow the steps outlined in the section above.
